This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It fulfills [Free Code Camp's project requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard):

* You can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who have earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
* You can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
* You can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brown points they've earned total.
